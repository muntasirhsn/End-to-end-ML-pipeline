# End-to-end-ML-pipeline
A comprehensive end-to-end machine learning pipeline that efficiently handles data preprocessing, model training, and prediction on test/inference data. The pipeline automates the workflow from data ingestion and feature engineering to model deployment, ensuring robust and scalable machine learning solutions. The initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development are also provided. House prices data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) for model training and prediction.

Pipeline was built by using Scikit-learn.

Run 'pipeline.py' to execute the pipeline
